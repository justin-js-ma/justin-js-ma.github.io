      <h2 class="serif">Overview</h2>
      <p>
        My research bridges molecular-level materials engineering with systems-level functionality. By developing tunable, printable, and reconfigurable platforms rooted in liquid crystal composites, I pursue applications spanning displays, communications, and intelligent surfaces. The ultimate goal is to establish a materials-driven pathway toward adaptive and programmable electronic systems of the future.

      <div class="grid">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Liquid-Crystal Technology</h3>
          <p>
            I explore advanced liquid-crystal composites through the integration of chemistry, materials science, and condensed-matter physics. By designing anisotropic mixtures with ferroelectric dopants, chiral agents, and reactive polymers, I aim to overcome limitations in dielectric response, response speed, and thermal stability. These materials are engineered for compatibility with both optical and high-frequency devices. The goal is to unlock next-generation LC systems that go far beyond display technologies—serving as intelligent and tunable mediums for a wide range of smart electronics.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Optoelectronics</h3>
          <p>
            I develop optical components that are electrically reconfigurable, ultra-thin, and versatile. My work includes smart windows with tunable transparency, polarization-dependent shutters, wide-viewing-angle displays, and devices that couple optical rotation with color modulation. These systems allow simultaneous control of intensity, color, and polarization of light, offering enormous potential in AR/VR, architectural optics, and information security. By combining optical physics with advanced LC chemistry, I pursue high-efficiency, multifunctional devices with minimal power footprint.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Microwave &amp; mmWave</h3>
          <p>
            At high frequencies, I integrate liquid crystals into reflective and transmissive platforms such as bandpass filters, phase shifters, RIS, and phased-array systems. My research emphasizes performance metrics such as low insertion loss, fast tunability, angular beam control, and system scalability. These devices are designed to meet the demands of future 6G networks, satellite communications, and reconfigurable antenna arrays. Liquid crystal engineering enables devices that are lighter, more agile, and more customizable than conventional semiconductor-based counterparts.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Printing & Patterning Technology</h3>
          <p>
            I leverage drop-on-demand printing and laser-assisted patterning to build functional architectures from the micro- to millimeter-scale. These techniques drastically reduce material consumption, simplify fabrication workflows, and eliminate lithographic constraints. By enabling customized design of multilayer LC devices, this approach supports the development of soft, flexible, and wearable electronics. My research envisions a future where LC-based sensors, antennas, and optical elements can be seamlessly integrated into textiles, robotics, or deformable substrates—truly programmable matter through precision printing.

        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Flexible & Wearable Healthcare Systems</h3>
          <p>
            As liquid crystal devices evolve toward flexible, soft, and skin-integrated platforms, I aim to extend their use into health monitoring and human-machine interfaces. By leveraging ultra-thin, printed LC sensors and optical elements, I explore applications in bio-signal detection, thermoregulation, and dynamic feedback systems. These systems are designed for comfort, stretchability, and biocompatibility—making them ideal for next-generation e-skin, rehabilitation devices, and real-time physiological monitoring. Through interdisciplinary integration of materials, electronics, and printing, I envision a future where smart LC-based components empower personalized healthcare and ubiquitous sensing.
